# Python mockup of ScopeMimicry

Pierre Haessig, March 2025

This small repo contains in the [Scopemimicry_Python.ipynb](Scopemimicry_Python.ipynb) Jupyter notebook a Python mockup of the C++ library [scopemimicry](https://github.com/owntech-foundation/scopemimicry) by OwnTech (which serves to record time series of variables within a microcontroller program)

The goal of this interactive mockup is to investigate potential issues like recording with a delay.
